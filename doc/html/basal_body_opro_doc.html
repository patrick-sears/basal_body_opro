<h3>Introduction.</h3>

<p>
The program <b>basal-body-opro</b> calculates ciliary orientations
from basal body and basal foot locations.
A user provides a file with these locations as x,y-coordinates.
Basal-body-opro matches each basal body with the closest foot
and calculates the ciliary orientation from those points.
The user also provides coordinates for cell boundaries.
The program uses these cell boundaries
to calculate a mean orientation for each cell.
</p>



<!-- _____________________________________________________ -->
<br><hr align="left" width="50%">
<h3>Program configuration.</h3>

<p>
The program needs the user to set a number of parameters.
The example contains a completely working configuration.
Most of the parameters won't need to be changed.
</p>

<p>
The parameters are all set in a configuration file.
Here is part of the example file to help explain how it works:
</p>


<pre class="code1">
# File name for the output image with cell centers marked.
!fname_z5 z55.png

# Image withd and height in pixels.
# !im_wh_px 512 512
!im_wh_px 1024 1024
</pre>

<p>
There are two types of line.
Lines starting with "#" are comments and are ignored by the program.
Lines starting with "!" are configuration lines.
Usually configuration lines appear in a "!key value" pair.
In the example above the key "!fanme_z5" is set to "z55.png".
Sometimes, a key is associated with two values.
For example, key "!im_wh_px" has two values, both are set to "1024".
Note putting a "#" in front of a key-value line turns it into a comment.
Such lines are useful for keeping alternate values in the file without actually using them.
</p>


<p>
Some keys have a more complicated pattern.
For example,
the key "!cell_basal_body_color"
must be followed by a set of lines,
each one starting with a color designation.
</p>

<h3>The two cell centers.</h3>

<p>
In the following description two images are important.
I'm going to call them <b>z4</b> and <b>z5</b> for short.
In the configuration, they have keys fname_z4 and fname_z5.
In the example, they are saved as z54.png and z55.png.
</p>

<p>
<b>The "x" and "o" centers.</b>
Looking at z4, each cell has a grey border
defined by a number of vertices.
For each cell, two centers are marked using an "x" and an "o".
The "x" marks the center of the vertices.
The "o" marks the center of the plane figure created by the cell border.
In z5, only the "o" plane figure centers are shown.
</p>

<p>
<b>The significance of the "x" center.</b>
The "x" centers are used to verify that border construction was done correctly.
For each cell, imagine lines going from the "x" center to each of the vertices for that cell.
If none of these lines crosses the cell border, the border is valid.
If one of these lines does cross a cell border,
the user must change the points used for that cell and re-run the program.
</p>

<p>
<b>The significance of the "o" center.</b>
The "o" center marks the center of the plane figure created by the border.
So it can be used as the true center of the cell.
This can be useful as a measure of the distance between cells.
Because the "o" center is the true cell center,
the mean orientation vector for each cell is plotted at the "o" center.
</p>

<p>
<b>Why two centers?</b>
The "x" center is important in validating the cell borders,
but otherwise it has no meaning.
But the "x" center is easy to calculate
and can be used to calculate the "o" center.
So image z4 should be used to inspect the work as it's being done
while the z5 image should be used for showing the results of the work.
</p>

<h3>Defining the cell borders.</h3>

<p>
The vertices for each cell are defined by the user in one of the input files.
In the configuration, that file has key fname_boundaries.
In the example, the file name is e02_boundaries.data
</p>

<p>
The input file  should have rows with the x and y coordinates for cell vertices.
Here is an example for two cells:
</p>

<pre class="code1">
X (um) Y (um)

12.48 29.77      # First cell
11.24 24.09
16.12 20.69
20.08 26.17
18.4 29.05
17.16 30.45

21.04 25.25      # Second cell
18.28 22.93
17.68 21.73
17.76 19.41
18.92 16.49
21.76 17.01
24.04 18.65
24.52 21.01
22.04 24.45
</pre>

<p>
Parts starting with "#" are just comments and are ignored.
There is one line per vertex.
The x and y values can be separated by a space or a tab.
Cells are separated by blank lines.
</p>

<p>
<b>I need to check the following to make sure this works.</b>
The units used for x and y values can be either um or pixels.
The chosen unit must be entered in the config file.
Use one of these settings:
</p>


<pre class="code1">
!indate_boundaries_units um
!indate_boundaries_units px
</pre>
